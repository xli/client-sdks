# Diem MiniWallet

MiniWallet is a highly simplified wallet application backend service API.

The API is a minimum interface for wallet applications to do peer to peer payment.


## Goals

1. Demonstrate SDK features for integrating an application with Diem Payment Network.
2. Play as counterparty wallet application for wallet applications CI builds.
3. Develop a standard test suite for improving the ramp-up time of building Diem wallet applications.
4. Develop a standard test suite for testing cross-language SDKs features.


## Use Cases

![Use Cases](mini_wallet/use-cases.png)


## API Specification

The MiniWallet API is organized around [REST], accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

We value simplicity in favor of performance in MiniWallet API design. Providing a minimum HTTP interface is key to achieve goals.


### Endpoints Overview

1. Server responses 200 for succeeded request.
2. For `POST` creation request, server should accept JSON encoded request body, and response created resource JSON as the body of the response; no `Location` header is required.
3. Server should set `Content-Type` header to `application/json` for JSON responses.
4. Server should respond 400 for client error,  and 500 for server internal error.
5. There is no requirement about the response body for errors; recommend human readable messages and stack traces for easy debugging.

### Resources

`Type` column flags:
1. `!`: read-only field, server sets value.
2. `?`: nullable field
3. `*`: write-only field, provided by client in request body for server, but server wonâ€™t respond to these data in the resource response body.

Reference resource id by the format: `<snake_case_resource_name>_id`, for example: `account_id` means `Account` resource `id` attribute value.


#### Account

Account holds KYC data, and all other resources are scoped by account id.

| Attribute  | Type               | Description                                                              |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`       | string!            | Id generated by server for this account resource.                        |
| `kyc_data` | string             | Valid [KycDataObject] JSON-encoded string.                               |
| `balances` | map[string, uint]* | Balance amount per currency code. Currency code is key, amount is value. |

> Server should send the account id as `additional_kyc_data`, if it is requested by the counterparty service


#### Balances

Account balances is a map of currency code to amount.
We can also consider it is an object has attributes named by currency code like the followings:

| Attribute | Type  | Description               |
|-----------|-------|---------------------------|
| `XUS`     | uint! | Amount of `XUS` currency. |
| `XDX`     | uint! | Amount of `XDX` currency. |



#### Payment URI

Payment URI is used for receiving payment from payers.
